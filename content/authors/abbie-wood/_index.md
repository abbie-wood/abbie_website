I am an ABD Ph.D. candidate and primary instructor at the University of Kentucky, set to receive my Ph.D. in Political Science in May of 2023. My research focuses on judicial politics and the determinants of behavior by United States Supreme Court justices.  

I am currently seeking new career opportunities in higher education administration. With over 5 years of experience at various higher education institutions, I have a wide range of skills and expertise as it pertains to understanding the needs of students and universities. 

My professional and educational career has allowed me to develop skills in professional writing, data collection and analytics, communicating complex information to various audience types, collaboration and teamwork, grant work, and institutional service. 

When not busy with work, I love spending time with my husband, drinking lots of coffee, running, watching sports, or reading!
